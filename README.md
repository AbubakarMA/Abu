Project Features

Data Generation: Creates realistic synthetic agricultural dataset with multiple factors
Exploratory Data Analysis: Comprehensive statistical analysis and visualization
Machine Learning: Implements multiple ML models for yield prediction
Feature Importance: Identifies key factors affecting crop yield
Model Comparison: Evaluates and compares different algorithms

Dataset Features
The synthetic dataset includes 1000 samples with the following features:

Environmental Factors: Temperature, rainfall, soil pH
Soil Nutrients: Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, organic matter
Management Practices: Irrigation frequency, fertilizer application
Crop Information: Crop type (Maize, Rice, Wheat, Sorghum), season
Target Variable: Crop yield (tons/hectare)

Key Findings

Temperature optimal range: 20-30°C for maximum yield
Soil pH between 6-7.5 shows best results
Organic matter content strongly correlates with yield
Different crops respond differently to environmental conditions
Random Forest model achieved R² > 0.85

Technologies Used

Python 3.8+
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Machine Learning: Random Forest, Linear Regression
Data Visualization: Correlation analysis, feature importance plots
